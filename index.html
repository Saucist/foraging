      What is Foraging?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Foraging is the act of searching for wild foods growing in nature. A forager might take expeditions into a pine forest to find mushrooms and NZ spinach, both of which I've seen growing on Mt. Victoria. Another might search for kawakawa and nettles for herbal teas.<br>
      Foraging is a great way to find tasty and healthy foods for very little cost. Foods can be found in many places, from rural areas and forests to urban areas, like paths and cracks in the pavement.<br>
      I have found wild carrots, blackberries, chickweed and watercress on the hill overlooking my childhood home in suburban Wellington. In Greytown, where I live now, Papawai's roads are lined with self-seeded wild plums and prickly pear. All of these are free and good to eat, and I advise you to take advantage of this.

    <h2>
      Why Forage?
    </h2>
    <p>
      As food prices rise across the globe, with organic foods expensive already, it is important to find a way to support you and your health. Foraging is a great way to do this, by finding unspoiled, natural foods that are good for you.<br>
      Plants like wild carrot and nettles are undomesticated, and so have higher nutrient contents than domestic carrots and spinach respectively. When these plants were domesticated, they were modified to bear more crop, at some loss of nutrients. This is why I try to incorporate wild foods into my diet, and why you should too.<br>
